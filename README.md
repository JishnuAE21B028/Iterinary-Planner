# Iterinary-Planner

This Streamlit application generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences, such as culture, food, shopping, and adventure activities in various cities worldwide. It leverages Neo4j for storing and retrieving user preferences and geolocation data from the Geopy library to recommend destinations. The app includes a simple memory agent that remembers user preferences for future use, enhancing the personalization of the itinerary generation process.

While the Map feature is missing, you can view the demo of the existing functionality in action. The demo video showcasing these features has been uploaded to Google Drive and the link has been submitted in the google form.
